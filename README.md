# Computational Workshops
Learn Python and Jupyter notebooks useful for research in the sciences.

Are you interested in undergraduate research and want to get a head start? Are you interested in learning the basics of Python programming?  These hands-on notebooks with built-in exercises for the user are meant to get you started with using Python for research. The notebooks were developed as a part of a workshop series at the California Polytechnic State University.

We use examples from physics experiments and models so that you can apply your programming knowledge to research-like problems. You will learn about arrays, loops, functions, files, and working with data. You do not need any experience with programming nor do you need to have taken physics courses.

To get started right away or to try out the activities, click below to run our workshop notebooks in Google Colab:
